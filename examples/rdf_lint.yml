# Example rdf-construct lint configuration
# Copy this to your project root as .rdf-lint.yml

# Strictness level
# - strict: warnings become errors, all rules run
# - standard: default severities apply (default)
# - relaxed: warnings become info, INFO rules skipped
level: standard

# Enable only specific rules (empty = all rules)
# Uncomment to enable selective linting
# enable:
#   - orphan-class
#   - missing-label
#   - dangling-reference

# Disable specific rules
# Useful for suppressing noise during early development
disable:
  - inconsistent-naming  # Allow flexible naming during prototyping

# Override default severity for specific rules
# Values: error, warning, info
severity:
  missing-comment: info     # Downgrade to info - comments nice-to-have
  property-no-domain: warning  # Upgrade from info - domains important

# Available rules:
#
# Structural (default: error):
#   - orphan-class: Class has no rdfs:subClassOf
#   - dangling-reference: Reference to undefined entity
#   - circular-subclass: Class is subclass of itself
#   - property-no-type: Property lacks rdf:type declaration
#   - empty-ontology: owl:Ontology has no metadata
#
# Documentation (default: warning):
#   - missing-label: Entity lacks rdfs:label
#   - missing-comment: Entity lacks rdfs:comment
#
# Best Practice (default: info):
#   - redundant-subclass: Redundant inheritance
#   - property-no-domain: Object property has no domain
#   - property-no-range: Object property has no range
#   - inconsistent-naming: Naming convention violations
