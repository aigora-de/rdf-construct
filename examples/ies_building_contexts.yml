# IES Building Ontology - UML Context Definitions
#
# This config defines focused diagram views for the IES Building ontology.
# Each context produces a separate PlantUML diagram showing a specific aspect.
#
# Usage:
#   # Generate all contexts
#   poetry run rdf-construct uml examples/ies-building.ttl ies_building_contexts.yml
#
#   # Generate specific context with IES styling
#   poetry run rdf-construct uml examples/ies-building.ttl ies_building_contexts.yml \
#     --context building_core \
#     --style-config examples/ies_colour_palette.yml --style ies_core
#
#   # Output to specific directory
#   poetry run rdf-construct uml examples/ies-building.ttl ies_building_contexts.yml \
#     --context envelope_components -o docs/diagrams/

# Namespace prefixes used in this config
# (These match the prefixes defined in the TTL file)

# ============================================
# Usage Examples
# ============================================
#
# 1. Generate the core building diagram:
#    poetry run rdf-construct uml examples/ies-building.ttl ies_building_contexts.yml \
#      --context building_core \
#      --style-config examples/ies_colour_palette.yml --style ies_core
#
# 2. Generate envelope components with metaclass emphasis:
#    poetry run rdf-construct uml examples/ies-building.ttl ies_building_contexts.yml \
#      --context envelope_components \
#      --style-config examples/ies_colour_palette.yml --style ies_metaclass
#
# 3. Generate all contexts to a specific directory:
#    poetry run rdf-construct uml examples/ies-building.ttl ies_building_contexts.yml \
#      --style-config examples/ies_colour_palette.yml --style ies_full \
#      -o docs/diagrams/building/
#
# 4. Generate minimal overview for presentations:
#    poetry run rdf-construct uml examples/ies-building.ttl ies_building_contexts.yml \
#      --context minimal_overview \
#      --layout-config examples/uml_layouts.yml --layout presentation
