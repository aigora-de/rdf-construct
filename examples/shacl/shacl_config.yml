# SHACL Generator Configuration
# ==============================
#
# This file configures how SHACL shapes are generated from OWL ontologies.
# Use with: rdf-construct shacl-gen ontology.ttl --config shacl-config.yml

# Strictness level controls which OWL patterns are converted:
#   minimal  - Basic type constraints only (sh:class, sh:datatype)
#   standard - Adds cardinality and functional property constraints (default)
#   strict   - Maximum constraints including enumerations, closed shapes
level: standard

# Default severity for constraint violations:
#   violation - Validation fails (default)
#   warning   - Logged as warning
#   info      - Informational only
default_severity: violation

# Generate closed shapes (sh:closed true)
# When true, instances cannot have properties not defined in the shape
closed: false

# Namespace suffix for generated shapes
# The shape namespace is derived from the ontology namespace + this suffix
shape_namespace: "shapes#"

# Target specific classes only (leave empty for all classes)
# Use local names or full URIs
target_classes: []
  # - Building
  # - Floor
  # - http://example.org/Person

# Exclude specific classes from shape generation
exclude_classes: []
  # - owl:Thing
  # - rdfs:Resource

# Include rdfs:label as sh:name in shapes
include_labels: true

# Include rdfs:comment as sh:description in shapes
include_descriptions: true

# Inherit property constraints from superclasses
# When true, subclass shapes include constraints from parent classes
inherit_constraints: true

# Generate top-level PropertyShapes (not just inline property constraints)
# Useful for reusable property validation rules
generate_property_shapes: false

# Properties to ignore in closed shapes
# These properties are allowed even when sh:closed is true
ignored_properties:
  - rdf:type
  - rdfs:label
  - rdfs:comment
  # - dcterms:created
  # - dcterms:modified
